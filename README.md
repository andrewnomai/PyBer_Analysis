# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Our task here for PyBer is to perform an exploratory anaylsis by utilizing visualizations to tell a compelling story about our data. Our analysis for this task is to use such charts to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of riders and drivers as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
